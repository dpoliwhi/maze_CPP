<h1>
  Implementation of SmartCalc v2.0.
</h1>

<body>
  <h3>General information</h3>
  <p>
    The program inplement an engineering version of calculator and have a simpe interface with input window and buttons
    (digits, operations, functions, etc.).<br>
    The engine of program works by <i>Dijkstra's algorithm</i> and every expresson translate into <i>Reverse Polish
      (bracketless) notation</i> and then calculate.<br>
    Also SmartCalc builds graphs in new window with coordinate grid if input string has unknown variable (<b>x</b>).
  </p>
  <h3>Operations</h3>
  <p>
    SmartCalc has ordinary operations with nambers, like <b>*, /, +, -, mod, pow</b>.<br> User can prioritize operations
    by
    using <b>(, )</b>. Also user can change sign of last input number by press button <b>+/-</b>.<br>For delate last
    symbol use
    <b>C</b>, and fo clearing all input string use <b>AC</b>.
  </p>
  <h3>Functions</h3>
  <p>
    SmartCalc has opportunity to calculate some trigonometric functions, like <b>cos(x), sin(x), tan(x), acos(x),
      asin(x), atan(x), sqrt(x), ln(x), log(x)</b>.<br> User can get a result with any number or can input unknown
    variable
    (<b>x</b>) and SmartCalc creates the graph of this function.
